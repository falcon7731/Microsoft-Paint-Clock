# Microsoft-Paint-Clock
 This python code draws the time in Microsoft paint in a digital style

 ## Installation
  1.clone the repository
  ```bash
git clone https://github.com/falcon7731/Microsoft-Paint-Clock.git
cd Microsoft-Paint-Clock
```
  2.Install the requirements?
   ```bash
pip install --upgrade -r "requirements.txt"
```

## Usage
  1.run the script
```bash
      python main.py
```
  2.open Microsoft paint
  3.ensure there is enough space for the time to be drawn
  4.hold Control, Shift and P at the same time
  
  To stop the program hold down Q; the program will terminate after it has cleared the screen. In case the control of the program is lost, try to jam the mouse at one of the corners of the screen


## Disclaimer
  I have only tested this program on a 1080p monitor, if you have a smaller monitor or can't run Microsoft paint in fullscreen I recommend changing the code before running it.
